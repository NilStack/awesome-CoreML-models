# Awesome Core ML models [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This repository has a collection of Open Source machine learning models which work with Apples **Core ML** standard.

Apple has published some of their own models. They can be downloaded [here](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/).
Those published models are: **SqueezeNet, Places205-GoogLeNet, ResNet50, Inception v3, VGG16** and will not be republished in this repository.

## Contributing
If you want your model added simply create a pull request with your repository and model added. In order to keep the quality of this repository high you have to conform to this project structure (taken from **@hollance**).

```
├── Convert
│   ├── coreml.py
│   ├── mobilenet_deploy.prototxt
│   └── synset_words.txt
├── MobileNet.mlmodel
```

There has to be a **Convert** directory with the Python script and additional data to reproduce this model on your own. If your model requires a huge amount of data please include a script which downloads those files. The **.mlmodel** file is optional because you'll have to push it onto this repository anyways.

```
├── MobileNetCoreML
│   ├── *.swift
├── MobileNetCoreML.xcodeproj
│   ├── project.pbxproj
│   └── project.xcworkspace
│       └── contents.xcworkspacedata
├── README.markdown
```

You also have to have an Xcode project where the user can test the model (sample data included would be nice).
